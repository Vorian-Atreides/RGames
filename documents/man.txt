There are several ways to run the software, but the easier will be to install Docker.

You should firstly install and Download Docker for Mac at:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac

Once docker installed, you should clone the project repository
Open a terminal and write:
$ git clone https://github.com/Vorian-Atreides/RGames
$ cd RGames/

Now you shave three different ways to run the project:

To run a standalone image, with each services running on separated thread
$ docker-compose up monolithic

To run several images, with each services running on a separated image:
$ docker-compose up cluster

To run each service independently of the others,
to let you configure the quantity of instances to run and on which machine:
$ docker-compose up proxy
$ docker-compose up engine
$ docker-compose up users
$ docker-compose up chat
$ docker-compose up rooms

For the last solution, be careful to run at least one of each instance to have a working service.
Moreover, at this moment the project support only one instance for:
- proxy
- engine
- users
- rooms
The two Diagrams are there to explain the current architecture and how it should/could be improved.


You can also run the unit test with this command:
$ network_file=local.cfg python3 -m unittest discover sources
You must be in the project's root directory
