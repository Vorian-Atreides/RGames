I fixed some issues with the document:
    - <=*gc instead of <= * gc
    - <= foo: welcome gc_reviewer! => hi there! instead of <= foo: welcome gc_reviewer!
                                                           => hi there!

I also added some errors messages which weren't specified:
    - Room not found
    - Room already exist (new feature)
    - Help message with wrong commands (Except login phases)

I added a feature to create a room:
=> /create roomName

It wasn't documented about the cases of exit and what to do when:
    - User /quit from a room
    - User brutaly quit from a room
So I follow a behavior as: /leave then /quit
